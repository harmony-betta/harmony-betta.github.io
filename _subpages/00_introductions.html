<p>In this first session I will explain what is "Harmony Framework". Harmony is not as good as other existing frameworks, the main purpose of making this framework to simplify my work as a Web Developer.</p>

<h4>Why do I create a Harmony Framework?</h4>

<p>Since I did not have the ability to learn fast, I was very old to understand something. Therefore I created Harmony Framework to make it easier for me to work. Although beyond that I also often find projects that have to use a variety of popular frameworks.</p>

	<p class="mb-0 small font-italic">The concept is quite simple from the Harmony Framework is a path that insha Allah can make it easier for other developers to understand it, and very friendly with beginner developers.</p>

<p>The Harmony Framework has the exact same flow as the <em>"Laravel Framework"</em>, so if you ever use <em>"Laravel"</em> you will not be confused by using the <b><em>"Harmony Framework"</em></b> and apply otherwise.</p>

<p>The Harmony Framework done behind the scenes is as follows: </p>

<h5 id="routes">1. Routes</h5>

<p>Routing in the Harmony Framework is the definition to redirect users to a specific URL. The first parameter '/' the slash will redirect the user to the root of the website, the second parameter is the name of the Controller that will process the URL request.</p>

<h5 id="controllers">2. Controllers</h5>

<p>In the <kbd>app/Controllers/HomeController.php</kbd> file there is a line of code that will process the request from the route. Each Controller has an index method that will be processed first and provide a response in the form of a template or just a string to display to the user.</p>

<h5 id="views">3. Views</h5>

<p>In the Controller we ask it to render the template 'home.twig' where <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" data-html="true"  title="User Interface">UI Logic</u> is represented there as the user interaction with the website.</p>
