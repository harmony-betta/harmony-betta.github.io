<p>In this first session I will explain what is "Harmony Framework". Harmony is not as good as other existing frameworks, the main purpose of making this framework to simplify my work as a Web Developer.</p>

<h4>Why do I create a Harmony Framework?</h4>

<p>Since I did not have the ability to learn fast, I was very old to understand something. Therefore I created Harmony Framework to make it easier for me to work. Although beyond that I also often find projects that have to use a variety of popular frameworks.</p>

<h4>What i need to start using Harmony?</h4>
<p>Harmony Framework pre-requirement :</p>
<ol>
	<li>PHP version "^5.5.9 | >=7.0.8"</li>
	<li>Composer (is Dependency Manager for PHP)</li>
	<li>Node JS also NPM coming from.</li>
</ol>

	<p class="mb-0 small font-italic">The concept is quite simple from the Harmony Framework is a path that insha Allah can make it easier for other developers to understand it, and very friendly with beginner developers.</p>
